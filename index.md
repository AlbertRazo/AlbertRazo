### CPSC 120

* Lab 1

    Lab 1 was only one part, and this is by far the best Lab that I have done for many reasons. The best reason is that this is the first set of code that I have ever done and is the beginning of a new era. This will be the first set of code, and I can look back at it and see where it all started and the progression that I have made. This Lab is by far the most important code that I will write to see my first Hello World.

* Lab 7

    Lab 7, part 2 was also one of my favorites by having the parking rules be given. For this Lab, I was able to write many if statements and really loved how there were many different functions that each did different things with different outputs. I also find this my favorite because I see this as something I can relate always checking the parking signs to make sure I have to move my car so I don't get a ticket, and I like to see how I can potentially make an app and have some knowledge to implement these functions since I did this Lab.

* Lab 3

    Lab 3, part 2 is the part of having the date difference when you input a date, and it tells you exactly how many days it has been since those two dates you input. I also love this because we can see we have to implement JulianDay using the Fliegel and Van Flandern equation to find out how many days it has been since the two dates that we input. Once we put those two dates, we can see the expected output, and it tells us the number of days between the two dates using the Gregorian Calendar.
